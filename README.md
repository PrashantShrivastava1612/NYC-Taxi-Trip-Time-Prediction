# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction
This GitHub repository contains the source code and datasets used for predicting the trip time of NYC taxi trips using regression algorithms.

The project aims to develop and evaluate several regression models to predict the duration of a taxi trip in New York City based on features such as pickup and dropoff locations, distance, weather conditions, and time of day. The models were trained and tested on a dataset of over 1.4 million taxi trips recorded in 2016, which was sourced from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).
